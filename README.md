# android_kernel_elephone_p8000
Kernel repository for Elephone P8000 (for stock roms/stock based roms, though it might be used with CM12.1 as well (see different defconfigs))
* thanks to BlueFlame4 for the initial kernel!  
In order to build the kernel, navigate to the kernel directory and call 'buildkernel.sh p8000_defconfig' (you might also use 0909p8000_defconfig and the cyanogenmod defconfig, depending on the target you are building the kernel for)
